# SQL--Fraud-Detection
This project involves analyzing banking transactions using SQL to detect potential fraud. We imported transaction data into MySQL, created a structured schema, and ran analytical queries to identify suspicious patterns. Key areas included high-value transactions, multiple logins, and unusual IP or device activity.
